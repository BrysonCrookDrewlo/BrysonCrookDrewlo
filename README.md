**AI & LLM Integration** — Suite of purpose-built tools for a self-hosted AI platform, connecting internal datasets, government APIs, and third-party services into a unified conversational interface.

**Full-Stack Applications** — Tenant-facing web applications and internal productivity tools built with Next.js and FastAPI, featuring mapping, real-time data sync, and intelligent classification.

**Workflow Automation** — End-to-end processing pipelines for email triage, site reporting, and task coordination using n8n orchestration with AI-powered categorization and routing.
